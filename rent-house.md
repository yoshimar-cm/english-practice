I'll try to tell you.
Last week a frind's soon turned twelve years old, and my friend decided to rend a cabin for celebrate his soon's happy berday.
The friend's soon invited her friends for celebrate and sleep in the cabin. I like that place, the cabin has a gasden, a pool also has a kitchen when you can make some food or you can sell food in a near restaurant, it's a big place and can sleep many people because the cabin can a kings size bed and a twins beds but you can rent another bed if you invited more people, but I don't like a thing, it's expensive for mi, the rent of the cabin is five tousen pesos per ninght, checkin is at 2:00 pm and the checkout is 11:00 am, but I think that is a especial day, maybe a celebration, and another thing about the cabain, you can carrier your pets.

I'd like to rent a cabin, well, it depends.

Let me explain.

Last week, the soon of friend turned twelve and decided to rent a cabin to celebrate his birthday.

He invited his friends over to celebrate and stay overnight. I like the place; it has a fireplace, a pool, and a kitchen where you can cook or buy food at a nearby restaurant. It's big and can sleep a lot of people, since it has a double bed and two single beds, but you can rent an extra bed if you invite more people. However, I don't like that it's expensive. The rental costs five thousand pesos per night, check-in is at 2:00 p.m., and check-out is at 11:00 a.m. I think it's a special day, maybe a celebration. Also, pets are allowed.
